# NLP Semantic Parsing

## Overview
The code is designed for exploring the intricate world of semantic interpretation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project focuses on parsing linguistic data and extracting meaningful semantic attributes. It leverages techniques like lambda-calculus and grammar manipulation to delve deep into the semantics of language, offering a unique perspective on understanding and processing natural language.

## Features
- **Semantic Attribute Computation**: Facilitates the automated extraction of semantic attributes from parsed language data.
- **Grammar Analysis and Manipulation**: Provides tools for analyzing grammatical structures and modifying them for enhanced semantic interpretation.
- **Lambda Calculus Integration**: Employs lambda-calculus for complex semantic analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of language semantics.
- **Script-Based Processing**: Utilizes scripting languages for efficient parsing, attribute computation, and data handling.

## Files
- **parse_script.py**: A Python script for parsing sentences and generating parse trees.
- **attribute_builder**: A Perl script designed to assign semantic attributes to parsed constituents.
- **sample_grammars**: Collection of grammar files in `.gra` format to demonstrate various attribute notations.
- **lambda_simplifier**: Utility script for lambda calculus expression simplification.

## Tech Stack
- **Perl**: Used for executing scripts related to attribute computation and grammar processing.
- **Python**: Applied for parsing operations and handling lambda calculus expressions.

## Libraries/Dependencies
- Perl environment for script execution.
- Python environment, optionally with rlwrap for enhanced command-line functionality.
